# codebase

In order to really try to dive in and learn ML and CS, I have been progressively writing more and more algorithms and data structures from scratch in Python.

These don't quite follow PEP 8 nor do they currently have any sort of uniform error handling protocols, but I may revisit them to implement these things. I will definitely add onto the ML module in the near future.
