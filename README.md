# codebase

As an exercise in refreshing/honing my computer science skills, I have been writing some data structures and algorithms (sorting and machine learning) by hand in Python.

For the structures file specifically, I will probably gradually improve the code over time. It is at a pretty workable level right now with some basic error handling and supporting multiple data types being inserted into the heaps for example. Not everything has been tested, but I will probably write more test cases in the future.

BIG NOTE: most of the code is uncommented for now, but I will fix that at some point.
