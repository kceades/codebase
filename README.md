# codebase

To refresh myself on details of how various things are implemented and how this affects their usage in code, I have been writing some data structures and algorithms (sorting and machine learning) by hand in Python.

They don't follow PEP 8 standards since it was more for my own benefit, but maybe I'll fix that someday. I will definitely add onto the ML module as I get time to write more algorithms.
